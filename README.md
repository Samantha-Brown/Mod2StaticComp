## Wins & Challenges

Wins: I completed the project even though I am experiencing grief due to the loss of my cat, Cali, RIP.

Challenges: I needed help with this project more than I expected. I used the grid structure in my tic-tac-toe project but this layout was far more complicated.

## Future Features

1. I would clean up the color contrasts between the pictures and the "views" count.
2. Adjust the photos to take up more of the info boxes so folks get a better idea of what they are seeing.
